<h1> My Portfolio (version 2) </h1>

I wanted to make improvements from my previous portfolio website (which I also built from scratch!) 
Some improvements include:
<ul>
  <li> More incremental and agile approach to development. Saving details such as colors, fonts, and writing content for later. </li>
  <li> Using plain + minimal CSS </li>
  <li> A more modern design </li>
  <li> Creating simple, low fidelity wireframes quickly (again, not spending too much time on details) </li> 
</ul>
